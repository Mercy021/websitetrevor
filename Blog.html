    <div class="test">
    <p>Patricia eventually marries Abel, Abels desire to control  the family<br>
      contrasts with his complete lack of control over himself, and he is drunk <br>
      he seems to have no empathy for the family and this is where you find that <br>
      he uses violence to control Patricia's actions. He cants stand to see Patricia <br>
      living on her own terms instead of listening to his control. Abel even beats <br>
      Trevor where Trevor avoids him for years. He continues attacking Patricia,<br>she
      calls the police and each time the police ignores her claims about Abel.<br>Eventually
      Abel buys a gun where he attempts to murder <br>Patricia in front of their kids. </p>

      <p> Abel is jailed, however,
      he gets off without even serving prison time.
      <br>You find that the South African Society viewed female domestic violence
      <br> victims as nothing important, taking an example of how Trevor explained
      <br> how the local police ignored his mother's claims of abuse. 
      As always Patricia<br>refuses to live by other peoples rules instead she stands her ground on principles.
      <br>Even though Patricia went all through this Abels attacks, 
      throwing herself infront<br> of her family during the incidence of Abel attempted murder shows that she is<br> selfless,
      she continues to own her family. Trevor also learns that love means<br> respecting and
      cooperating with someone's background, he also explains that <br>relationships are not 
      sustained by violence but love. And love is a creative act.<br> When 
      you love someone you create a new world for them. This story <br>shows that the culture of violence, abuse
      which is also happening even today.<br> Where you find that the government
      itself never takes suffering seriously especially <br>violence on women.</p>

      <h2>Humour</h2>
      <img width="300"  height="200" src="./images/hum.jpg">
      
      <p>Trevor Noah has displayed a lot of humor in the Novel 
      Born a<br> Crime, where he uses humor to get out of hard situations
      , and <br>also you find that he uses humor to help his family heal.
      An<br> example is where he went to see her mother in the hospital,<br>
      and he explains how her mother used humor to make him feel<br> better
      and he said, “My mom looks at me and she goes, ‘Shhh, <br>
      Trevor, shhh, don’t cry, baby.’ I say, ‘No, mom, I’m gonna cry,<br> 
      you were shot in the head!’ ‘No, no no, 
      look on the bright side.’<br> ‘What bright side?’ 
       At least now, because of my nose, you’re <br> officially 
       the best-looking person in the family.”
       Humor<br> is also displayed during the letter-writing between 
       Trevor<br> and his mom, Trevor explains that his life and 
       her mother's life<br> turned in to a courtroom drama,
       There was also an incidence<br> where Trevor doing shit on a newspaper 
       then he hides it at the<br> bottom of the dustbin, and when here mother comes she
       says <br>that they had been bewitched, Trevor is called
       from the <br> bedroom to see what had happened but<br> he  played dumb about it.</p>

       <img width="300"  height="200" src="./images/humo.jpg">

       <p>Trevor after breaking the rules about communion at Friday mass<br> 
       at his school where he decides to get some Jesus blood and Jesus body.<br>
       Where he says"I'm going to get me some Jesus blood and Jesus body".<br> 
       He would argue with the nuns and the priest all the time,
       where he <br>would ask why they couldn't drink Jesus' blood and other kids did.
       the <br>response would be because he was not a Catholic.
       Trevor's response after<br> been told that was just humorous.
       Trevor is so naughty whereby he was<br> 
       playing with his two cousins and he accidentally perforated Bulelwa <br> 
       eardrum and he was bleeding. The grandmother hits his two cousins leaving <br> 
       Trevor alone. The grandmother did not hit Trevor because he was white<br> 
       and she didn't know how to hit a white child. Where she says that.
        "A black<br> child you hit him and he stays", but 
        "Trevor once you hit him he turns<br> blue and green and yellow and red".
        This instance of humor was<br> so humorous. You find that Trevor used humor  to make the story so<br> 
        interesting and also to get from trouble,
        him been a white kid at that time.</p>
